    "#### Can we predict whether two heterosexual people matched or not based on 6 attributes after 4 minutes of speed dating? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction:\n",
    "\"Speed dating\" is a matchmaking process that involves two people getting to know one another within a very short time frame (usually less than 10 minutes), and then switching to another person once the time is up. This speedy and energetic approach to meeting other single people may result in a match between two individuals where they both choose to pursue dating. But what factors influence whether or not two people match? <b> Is there a way to predict whether two people will match or not in a speed date based on certain attributes? </b> \n",
    "The Speed Dating dataset posted by Ulrik Thyge Pedersen gathered data from participants in a four-minute speed dating experiment where they were asked to rate their date on six different attributes: attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, ambition, and shared interests. Using this data, we will attempt to predict whether or not two people will match based on these attributes."
